# Ballista Developer Documentation

This directory contains documentation for developers that are contributing to Ballista. If you are looking for 
end-user documentation for a published release, please start with the [user guide](https://ballistacompute.org/docs/).

## Contributing to the Rust project

- Setting up a [development environment](dev-env-rust.md).
- [How to test the Rust executor](testing-rust-executor.md).
- How to [build the Rust docker image](rust-docker.md).

## Contributing to the JVM project

## Test Data

- How to generate [TPC-H](../benchmarks/tpch) data.

## Testing

## Benchmarks

The goal is to be able to run the complete [TPC-H](../benchmarks/tpch) benchmark and use that for comparisons with 
other distributed platforms, but Ballista can't support many of the queries yet.

## Release

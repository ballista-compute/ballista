# Ballista integration with Apache Spark

This project contains:

- Spark benchmarks and utilities for TPC-H and NYC Taxi
- Ballista Spark Executor (prototype)
- Spark V2 Connector for Ballista (prototype)

## Build

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

## Build Benchmark Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t ballistacompute/spark-benchmarks:0.4.0-SNAPSHOT -f benchmarks/Dockerfile .
```

## Ballista Spark Executor

Executor implementing the Ballista protocol (Apache Flight + protobuf-encoded Ballista query plans), allowing Spark to be used from any language supported by Ballista, including Java, Kotlin, Scala, and Rust.

## Spark V2 Connector for Ballista

The goal for this component is to allow Spark to interact with Ballista executors (Rust, Kotlin, and Spark executors exist).
